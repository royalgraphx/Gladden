  <h2>Rules:</h2>
  <p>1. Each player has a store on one side of the board.</p>

    <p>2. Players take turns choosing a pile from one of the holes. Moving counter-clockwise, stones from the selected pile are deposited in each of the following hole until you run out of stones.</p>

    <p>3. If you drop the last stone into your store - you get a free turn.</p>

    <p>4. If you drop the last stone into an empty hole on your side of the board - you can capture stones from the hole on the opposite side.</p>

    <p>5. The game ends when all six holes on either side of the board are empty.
  If a player has any stones on their side of the board when the game ends - he will capture all of those stones.</p>
