  <p>3. To win, you must reduce your score to exactly zero.</p>
  
  <p>4. If your total score gets below zero - it's called a BUST. BUST results in losing your turn while your score gets reset to the way it was before your turn. </p>
  
  <p>5. If you reduce your score to zero before your opponent and you were the player to make the first turn - then your opponent will have a last chance to draw the game.</p>
